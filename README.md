# markup-notes
A simple app to take notes.

# What do I want!?
An minimalist app that does a few things well:

a. Allows me to take notes in markup or plain text.
b. Allows me to do that both on web and through an app.
c. Uses github as a backend for the notes, which allows seamless porting.
d. Syncs acroos interfaces + github.
e. Has some search functionality.

# Stack
Probably a simple react app for web, and react native for the app.
Likely using Next.js as a lightweight framework, and Now hosting, for web.
Do I need any other backend?

Things I have to figure out:
* accounts
* github syncing
